    "In this tutorial, we will delve into the implementation details of heyoka.py's expression system. Our main goal is to explain certain pitfalls that can occur in innocent-looking code and which can have disastrous consequence on performance, and to teach you, dear user, how to avoid these pitfalls.\n",

    "## Reference semantics and shared (sub)expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most important thing to understand about heyoka.py's expressions is that they implement so-called *reference semantics*. That is, an expression is essentially a handle to an underlying object, and copying the expression will not perform an actual copy, rather it will return a new reference to the same underlying object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you ask \"isn't this how all Python objects work?\", let me immediately point out that heyoka.py's expressions are exposed from C++ and that reference semantics is implemented all the way down into the C++ layer. As a concrete example of what this means, consider the following simple expression:"
